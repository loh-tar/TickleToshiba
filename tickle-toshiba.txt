systemd Service Setup Notes
=============================
The following hints are for those who are not an expert. Experts may know other
ways to get it running too. Here we will setup the tickle service for a single
user. Whenever the user plug in his blasted_drive and let it mount by his
desktop environment, the tickle daemon will auto started by systemd.

TickleToshiba comes with two systemd service files. When you enable one of these
service will be some text printed containing...

    "added as a dependency to a non-existent unit"

..don't worry, that's OK!


1) tickle-@.service
---------------------
Which should be ready to use after install. To do so run as normal user:

    $ systemctl --user enable tickle-@YourDriveLabel.service

That's it. The service file starts the daemon with a tickle interval of 160sec.
If you need a different time you need to edit the file, sorry. You may found it
at /usr/lib/systemd/user/tickle-@.service. To avoid that possible future updates
overwrite your handy work you should rename the file or move it to a save place
like /etc/systemd/user. In any doubt consult systemd documentation.

If your drive don't have a label, consider to change that. It may not mandatory
but was not tested. However, to get the data you need, see below at Blue Print.

Hint: Some label may cause trouble, like with hyphens "-". Change the label or
use the 2) option.


2) tickle-toshiba.service
---------------------------
Which is part of this file, see below Blue Print. Copy the relevant parts into
a file <whatever-name>.service, below one of these directories:

    ~/.config/systemd/user or ~/.local/share/systemd/user

They may not exist, create them. Then run like above:

    $ systemctl --user enable <whatever-name>.service

That's it.


Verify Success
================
The easiest way should be to run...

    $ journalctl -f

...and then to plug in the drive in question. Alternatively, you can also see
what had happened like this:

    $ systemctl --user status <the-new-tickle>.service

When you remove the drive will the daemon exorcise himself.
Of cause you can stop the tickling temporary manually, for whatever reason...

    $ systemctl --user stop <the-new-tickle>.service

...or restart manually...

    $ systemctl --user start <the-new-tickle>.service

Have fun!

When you compare the advices at the link with the hints following, you may
notice that here we have "run-media-" whereas there is only "media-", perhaps
due to Ubuntu/ArchLinux differences. Who knows.

These advices are fitting to KDE/Plasma with udisks mount helper, other systems
may differ. Run the commands as normal user:

1. Connect and mount your drowsy drive
2. systemctl list-units -t mount
3. Copy the data with your drive in the outer left column "UNIT" and modify
   the blue print accordingly. Save as new file as noted in 2) above.
4. Enable the new created service as shown above. You are done!

In case of trouble, due to some typo in the new file, just fix it and run...

   $ systemctl --user daemon-reload

...or alternatively

    $ systemctl --user reenable <the-new-tickle>.service
